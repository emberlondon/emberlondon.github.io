    title: Building delicious forms with Ember.js
    abstract: Often when building a form we are happy once the models are hooked up and our data is being saved. In practice, a good data entry experience has many more considerations that are easily met with the Ember.js ecosystem. We will build a set of example code for form UI that uses ember-concurrency, validations and error handling.

    title: Let's shake some trees
    abstract: Hear about how we are using recast with Ember CLI at British Gas to only provide our web applications with the ember data models they need from a shared addon that contains all our models. You will also learn about abstract syntax trees and how Ember’s commitment to backward compatibility has influenced the way we introduce changes to our private shared addons.
