# Ember London Speaker Guidelines

---

Please provide the following at least **2 weeks** in advance of the event:

- A good quality photograph of yourself
- The title of your talk
- A one-sentence abstract that answers the question:  
  *what will I learn from this talk?*

Email these to [talk@emberlondon.com](mailto:talk@emberlondon.com).

---

Please consider the following when preparing your talk:

- Your talk should be **10–30 minutes** long
- The projector resolution is **1920x1080**  
  (your slides don’t *have* to be 16:9 but we find they look best at that aspect)
- Do not use a pure white background  
  (the projector gets confused)
- You will be using your own laptop  
  (let us know if you’d rather not)
- Feel free to live code  
  (we can capture it just fine)
- SSH is blocked but we can work around it for Git with this command:  
  ```
  git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
  ```
- Avoid content which may make people uncomfortable  
  (if in doubt, please ask)
- If you intend to adapt the Tomster (Ember’s hamster mascot)  
  please let us know (the adaptation will need approval)
- If you use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/), remember to disable it prior to  
  delivering your talk

We’re very happy to help prepare and review your slides. If you’d like to rehearse, let us know and it can be arranged.
