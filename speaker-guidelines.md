# Ember London Speaker Guidelines

First of all, please review our [code of conduct](https://github.com/emberlondon/code-of-conduct)
before deciding to attend Ember London, be it as a speaker or otherwise.

Please provide the following in advance of the event:

- The title of your talk
- A short abstract that answers the question:
  *what will I learn from this talk?*

We often record our talks and create promotional materials with pictures
of our speakers, but **only with their consent**. This is completely optional
and not required to speak at Ember London. Please let us know:

- Do you consent to our using your image to promote the meetup?
  - If you do, please provide a good quality photograph of yourself that we can use.
- Do you consent to your talk being recorded and published online?

Email these to [talk@emberlondon.com](mailto:talk@emberlondon.com).

Please consider the following when preparing your talk:

- Please review the official [Tomster FAQ](http://emberjs.com/tomster/faq/)
  and [logo documentation](http://emberjs.com/logos/)
  before working on any custom adaptations.
- Your talk should be **5–20 minutes** long
- 5 minute talks are very welcome
- Each slot is 30 minutes max, including Q&A
- Avoid content which may make people uncomfortable
  Particularly jokes with sexual connotations
  (if in doubt, please ask)
- By default, we assume that you will be using your own laptop. Please let us
  know if you’d rather not.
- Feel free to live code; we can capture it just fine.
- Non-HTTP traffic (eg: SSH) might be blocked. It depends on the venue. Please
  let us know if you'll need it so that we can accommodate or find workarounds.
- If you use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/), remember to disable it prior to
  delivering your talk
- If your talk will be recorded, please wear an outfit with pockets.
  We'll get you wired up with a lapel microphone, and the other end of the cable
  has a small box that you'll need to carry in your pocket.

We’re very happy to help prepare and review your slides. If you’d like to rehearse, let us know and it can be arranged.
