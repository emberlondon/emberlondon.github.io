# Ember London Speaker Guidelines

Please provide the following at least **2 weeks** in advance of the event:

- A good quality photograph of yourself
- The title of your talk
- A one-sentence abstract that answers the question:
  *what will I learn from this talk?*

Email these to [talk@emberlondon.com](mailto:talk@emberlondon.com).

---

Please consider the following when preparing your talk:

- Please review the official [Tomster FAQ](http://emberjs.com/tomster/faq/)
  and [logo documentation](http://emberjs.com/logos/)
  before working on any custom adaptations.
- Your talk should be **5–20 minutes** long
- 5 minute talks are very welcome
- Each slot is 30 minutes max, including Q&A
- Avoid content which may make people uncomfortable
  Particularly jokes with sexual connotations
  (if in doubt, please ask)
- Review our [code of conduct](https://github.com/emberlondon/code-of-conduct)
- The projector resolution is **1920x1080**
  (your slides don’t *have* to be 16:9 but we find they look best at that aspect)
- Do not use a pure white background
  (the projector gets confused)
- You will be using your own laptop
  (let us know if you’d rather not)
- Feel free to live code
  (we can capture it just fine)
- SSH is blocked but we can work around it for Git with this command:
  ```
  git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
  ```
- If you use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/), remember to disable it prior to
  delivering your talk

We’re very happy to help prepare and review your slides. If you’d like to rehearse, let us know and it can be arranged.
